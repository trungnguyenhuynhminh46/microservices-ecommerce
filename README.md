# 🛒 Ecommerce Microservices System

This is a backend project for an ecommerce platform designed using **microservices architecture**. The system is built to be **modular**, **scalable**, and **event-driven**, applying key architectural patterns such as:

- ✅ **Microservices** – to decompose the application into smaller, manageable services.
- ✅ **Event-Driven Architecture** – to enable asynchronous communication between services.
- ✅ **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** – to model the business domain effectively.
- ✅ **Saga Pattern** – to manage distributed transactions across services.
- ✅ **Outbox Pattern** – to ensure reliable event delivery.
- ✅ **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** – to optimize for scalability and performance.
- ✅ **Clean and Hexagonal Architecture** – to maintain separation of concerns and testability.
- ✅ **Database per Service** – to ensure data ownership and independence.
- ✅ **Kafka** – to facilitate asynchronous communication between services.

This project consists of multiple backend APIs responsible for managing product information, user data, and inventory. The core focus is on the order placement flow, as it represents a complex, cross-service use case that involves coordination across multiple microservices.

## 💡 Motivation

The motivation behind this project stems from my desire to gain practical experience in designing distributed systems that are not only functional, but also scalable, resilient, and aligned with real-world architectural principles. Rather than stopping at theoretical knowledge, I wanted to build a system that forces me to solve problems commonly encountered in production — such as service coordination, data consistency, and domain complexity.

A central goal of this project is to internalize and apply **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**. DDD provides a powerful way to break down a complex business problem into meaningful components that reflect the reality of the domain. In this project, I structured services around bounded contexts, defined aggregates carefully to maintain transactional boundaries, and used value objects and entities to model real business behavior. More importantly, DDD encouraged clear communication between code and business logic — allowing the technical design to evolve naturally from the problem space.

To manage the complexity of cross-service transactions, I applied the **Saga Pattern**, particularly using the choreography approach. Instead of relying on a central coordinator, services communicate via domain events to react and proceed in the transaction chain. This allows each service to stay autonomous while still participating in a long-running business process, such as placing an order. The compensation logic ensures that partial failures are gracefully handled, which is essential in a distributed environment.

In support of reliable event-driven communication, I implemented the **Outbox Pattern**. This pattern solves the common problem of atomicity between database writes and message publishing. By first storing domain events in a local outbox table within the same database transaction, and then asynchronously publishing them to Kafka, the system avoids inconsistencies between state and side effects — a crucial requirement for maintaining integrity across microservices.

Overall, this project is more than just an academic exercise. It’s a focused effort to deeply understand and apply modern backend engineering principles in a practical, hands-on way. Through it, I’ve learned to design better systems, think more clearly about architectural trade-offs, and prepare myself to handle the challenges of building reliable, maintainable software at scale.

## 🏗️ System Overview

The platform is composed of the following services:

| Service              | Responsibility                                |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **IdentityService**  | Manages user registration and authentication  |
| **ProfileService**   | Manages user profiles and preferences         |
| **ProductService**   | Handles product catalog and product info      |
| **InventoryService** | Manages stock levels and reservations         |
| **OrderService**     | Handles order creation and orchestration      |
| **PaymentService**   | Simulates payment gateway interaction         |

Other components

| Component       | Responsibility                                                    |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Api gateway** | Handles incoming requests and routes them to appropriate services |
| **Kafka**       | Message broker for asynchronous communication between services    |

All services communicate asynchronously using **Apache Kafka**, and each service manages its own database (**Database per Service** pattern).

## 🎯 Nonfunctional Requirements

The system must meet the following nonfunctional requirements to ensure high performance, maintainability, and reliability:

- **Scalability**: The architecture must support horizontal scaling to handle increased load during peak usage.
- **Availability**: The system should maintain a high availability rate using redundancy and fault-tolerant services.
- **Resilience**: One failure should not cascade to other services. Each service should be able to recover independently.
- **Performance**: The APIs should be fast and responsive, with low latency and high throughput.
- **Maintainability**: The codebase must follow clean architecture principles and be modular to enable easy updates and testing.
- **Consistency**: Eventual consistency should be ensured across microservices through asynchronous communication patterns (e.g., Kafka + Outbox pattern).
- **Message Driven**: The system should be designed to handle asynchronous events and messages, allowing for decoupled communication between services.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This is a simplified e-commerce system built with Spring Boot, following the microservices architecture.
The system consists of 6 independent services, each with its own dedicated database, ensuring clear separation of concerns and better scalability. These services communicate with each other asynchronously via Kafka as the message broker, enabling reliable message delivery and improving the system's fault tolerance.

## 🔄 Order State transitions

This system defines an application that operates across five distinct states:
- **PENDING**: The initial state triggered when a request is first submitted to the system.
- **PAID**: The state entered once the customer successfully completes the payment.
- **APPROVED**: The state achieved when the inventory confirms stock availability after payment is processed.
- **CANCELLING**: An intermediate state indicating the order is in the process of being canceled, which may occur if the inventories don't have enough stock to fulfill the order, require a refund.
- **CANCELLED**: A final state where order processing ceases due to non-payment, the inventories not having enough stock to fulfill the order, and the payment is cancelled successfully.

The image below illustrates the order state machine.

## 🛒 Order Placement Flow
When a user send a request in order to create a new order. The process create and complete the order basically consists of two main stages:
1. **Complete payment**: The Order Service send a complete payment request for the payment service.
2. **Inventory confirmation**: The Order Service send a confirmation request to the Inventory Service to confirm if the goods are available for fulfillment.

Despite the simplicity of these two stages, the microservices-based architecture, which delegates tasks across multiple services, demands robust mechanisms to maintain transaction consistency and address potential errors. To achieve this, the solution implements the SAGA pattern. The diagram provided below outlines the complete transaction process, encompassing a total of 14 distinct steps.

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Step 1**: Install Docker & Docker compose

Docker and docker-compose must be installed and running on your local machine in order to build the images for the four services (Order, Payment, Restaurant, and Customer) and set up the local Kafka cluster.

Run the commands in a terminal and verify that the output matches the expected results:

```
$ docker --version
Docker version 24.0.7, build afdd53b4e3

$ docker-compose --version
Docker Compose version 2.23.3
```

**Step 2**: Install Databases, including Mysql, Neo4j and Redis

Follow belows script to initialize database by docker. You can skip this step if you want to use your own local database.

```bash
cd ./infrastructure/docker-compose
docker-compose -f init_databases.yml up -d
```

**Step 3**: Initialize kafka cluster on docker
- Once you have Docker and Docker-compose installed on your computer, run the following commands to initialize the kafka cluster:
```bash
cd ./infrastructure/docker-compose
docker-compose -f kafka_cluster.yml up -d
docker-compose -f init_kafka.yml up -d
```

**Step 4**: Configure CMAK

- Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:9001/](http://localhost:9001/);
- Once the page loads, go to the **Cluster** menu at the top and select **Add Cluster**;
- In the **Cluster Name** input, type `tuber-cluster` or choose another name you prefer;
- For the **Cluster Zookeeper Hosts** field, provide the Zookeeper hostname and port. For example: `zookeeper:2181`;
- Click **Save** to complete the process;
- Return to the homepage — the newly added cluster should now appear in the list of active clusters.


**Step 5**: Building

In the terminal, run the following command line:
```
$ mvn clean install
```

**Step 6**: Running the micro-services in IDE

You can run microservices directly from your preferred IDE, such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, VS Code, or any other.

To do so, execute the file ServiceApplication.java located within the *-container submodule, here are those files:
- [ProfileServiceApplication.java](profile-service%2Fprofile-container%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Ftuber%2Fprofile%2Fservice%2Fdomain%2FProfileServiceApplication.java)
